# hangman

My version of *hangman* for [100 Days of Code](https://www.udemy.com/course/100-days-of-code/)

## Features:

* Guess pool comprised of an unprecedented selection of 26, state of the art, fully-updated, smartphone-compatible, English language letters
* Crisp and perfectly straightened underscore place markers - *Easily see where nothing is and where something isn't yet.* 
* For possibly the first time in hangman history, **over 200** possible words to guess.
* *Free Bitcoin* not included
* Unbelievably realistic graphics - **realer** *than real life*

> "The first time I lost a life in 'hangman', I nearly hollered in horror thinking the insanely lifelike graphics were real life and the head rendered in game actually hanged before my queasy eyes."
- Burt Turbosay, Game Informant
